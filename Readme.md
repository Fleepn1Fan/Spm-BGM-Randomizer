## How to use:
### Patcher verion (More likely to crash) 
-Extract Spm ISO in a folder called spm  
-Put SpmBgmRandomizer in the same directory as Spm and Replace folder

-If the data folder is missing, create it and move all files and folders inside spm into it,then put data inside spm   
-Open SpmBgmRandomizer  
-Rebuild the ISO

### Riivolution version (Recommended)
